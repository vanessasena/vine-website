    "subtitle": "A Church of Overcomers",
    "content": "What does it mean to be a church of overcomers? It means being a church that fulfills God's purpose. And what is that purpose? To have a group of people in His image and likeness. God desires to fill man with Himself, with His life, in order to express Himself. So that man may have His dominion and represent Him on Earth.",
    "content2": "Man was created as a vessel to contain God within himself. We were made like a glove to contain God. The glove is the image and likeness of the hand, but the hand is the reality of the glove. A glove is created according to the likeness of the hand for the purpose of containing it. Likewise, man was created in the image of the Lord for the purpose of containing Divinity.",
    "content3": "Once man receives the Person of God as life within himself, he becomes an instrument in His hands.",
    "content4": "For man to be used as an instrument, God gave him the following command: Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the heavens, and over every animal that crawls on the earth. (Gen 1:28)",
