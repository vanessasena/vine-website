    "content": "What does it mean to be a church of overcomers? It means being a church that fulfills God's purpose. And what is that purpose? To have a group of people in His image and likeness. God desires to fill man with Himself, with His life, in order to express Himself. So that man may have His dominion and represent Him on Earth.",
    "content2": "Man was created as a vessel to contain God within himself. We were made like a glove to contain God. The glove is the image and likeness of the hand, but the hand is the reality of the glove. A glove is created according to the likeness of the hand for the purpose of containing it. Likewise, man was created in the image of the Lord for the purpose of containing Divinity.",
    "content3": "Once man receives the Person of God as life within himself, he becomes an instrument in His hands.",
    "content4": "For man to be used as an instrument, God gave him the following command: Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the heavens, and over every animal that crawls on the earth. (Gen 1:28)",

    "sundayKids": "Sunday Kids (Service)",
    "sundayKidsDescription": "Services for children and teens take place in the church building on the same day and time as adult and youth services. Children's service is not entertainment or something we do just so they don't disturb the adult service. We understand that children can worship and relate to God spontaneously and genuinely.",
    "sundayKidsContent": "On Sundays they participate in a service with stories, plays, which also includes worship, word, prayer and even tithes and offerings. During the service they have the opportunity to participate and learn these elements of Christian life, and they really practice all of this!",
    "cellsKids": "Kids Life Groups",
    "cellsKidsDescription": "Life groups are the church that meets in homes weekly. Kids life groups meet at the same time as adult life groups, on the same day and location. The life group aims at spiritual supply for children through fellowship, edification, service and evangelism.",
    "spiritualProcess": "Spiritual Process in Childhood",
    "spiritualProcessDescription": "We work through a planned process that reaches up to 12 years of the child's life, it is the spiritual process in childhood. We invest in this process by evangelizing, teaching and training.",

    "evangelismVerse": "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. Mark 16:15",

    "teaching": "Teaching",
    "teachingDescription": "We focus on three very practical aspects of learning: content, repetition and practice. The teaching of God's Word is the same in life groups and services, and happens through spiritual principles that are drawn from biblical stories.",
    "training": "Training",
    "trainingDescription": "The goal of training is the priesthood of every believer. Our objective is not just to teach about salvation, but we want to see children being saved. We don't just want to teach about prayer, but we want children to learn to pray, to feel loved, forgiven and accepted by God.",
    "trainingMethod": "Training the priesthood of every believer means practicing the Word, from the simplest act of praying to prophesying. Just as faith is needed to evangelize, so it is to train. Training of children and teens happens through projects.",
    "projects": "Projects are carried out in life groups and also in services. All children's life groups simultaneously carry out projects and aim at training."

    "whatIsCell": "What is a life group?",
    "whatIsCellDescription": "A life group is a small group of people who meet regularly to share life, grow in faith and reach other people for Christ. These groups are similar to the first Christian gatherings described in the New Testament, where they met in homes for fellowship, teaching and prayer (Acts 2:46-47). Each life group functions as a \"mini church,\" providing a welcoming and familiar environment where each person can be cared for and discipled personally.",
    "whyCells": "Why do we have life groups?",
    "whyCellsDescription": "The life group strategy is fundamental to Vine Church because it follows the biblical model of growth and multiplication. Jesus made disciples in small groups and sent them out to do the same. The purpose of life groups is to promote spiritual edification, develop healthy relationships and strengthen the body of Christ. Additionally, life groups allow the church to be more effective in evangelization, reaching people who might never attend a traditional service. Through the life group format, the Church not only grows in numbers, but also in spiritual maturity and fellowship.",
